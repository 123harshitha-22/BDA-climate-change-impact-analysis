# BDA-climate-change-impact-analysis
To leverage satellite imagery and deep learning techniques to analyze and predict the impacts of climate change, focusing on factors such as deforestation, glacial melting, urban heat islands, and changes in vegetation.
# key features
Data Acquisition:

Use satellite imagery from sources like NASA Landsat, ESA Copernicus (Sentinel), or commercial platforms.
Focus on regions experiencing significant climate change effects (e.g., polar regions, rainforests, deserts).
Data Preprocessing:

Convert raw satellite data (e.g., multispectral or hyperspectral images) into usable formats.
Handle large datasets using Big Data tools like Apache Spark or Hadoop.
Geospatial preprocessing using libraries like GDAL or GeoPandas.
Deep Learning Models:

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for feature extraction and classification of environmental changes.
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for temporal pattern detection.
Pretrained models like ResNet, UNet, or Transformer-based Vision models.
Analysis Goals:

Deforestation: Identify and quantify forest loss using vegetation indices (e.g., NDVI).
Glacial Melting: Monitor the reduction in glacier areas over time.
Urban Heat Islands: Analyze the increase in temperatures in urban areas.
Crop and Vegetation Health: Detect droughts or changes in vegetation patterns.
Visualization & Insights:

Interactive dashboards using Tableau, Power BI, or custom tools built with Plotly Dash.
Display heatmaps, trends, and predictions of environmental changes.
Deployment:

Use cloud platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure for scalability.
APIs for real-time updates and data access.


#Potential Applications:

Predicting climate-related disasters (e.g., floods, droughts).
Monitoring compliance with environmental policies.
Assisting governments and NGOs in resource management.
Educating the public on climate change impacts.
